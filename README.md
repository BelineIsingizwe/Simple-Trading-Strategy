# Simple Trading Strategy: Moving Average Crossover

This project implements and backtests a **Moving Average Crossover Trading Strategy** using Apple.Inc historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. The strategy compares the performance of buying and selling based on short-term and long-term moving average crossovers against a simple buy-and-hold approach.

## Overview

The Moving Average Crossover strategy generates:
- **Buy signals** when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average.
- **Sell signals** when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

The aim is to determine if this technical strategy can outperform a traditional buy-and-hold investment approach.

## Results

### Cumulative Returns Comparison
The graph below shows the performance of the **strategy returns** (orange line) compared to the **market returns** (blue line). While the market consistently outperformed the strategy over the observed period, the strategy reduced risk during market corrections, as evident in the flatter sections of the orange line.

### Buy/Sell Signals
The chart below shows the stock's price (Apple, in this case) along with the short-term and long-term moving averages. The **green markers** represent buy signals, and the **red markers** represent sell signals. These signals were generated by the crossover of the moving averages.

## Key Observations

1. **Market Outperformance:**  
   The buy-and-hold strategy (market returns) outperformed the moving average crossover strategy over the period.

2. **Risk Mitigation:**  
   The crossover strategy exited the market during major drawdowns (e.g., early 2020), reducing exposure to volatility.

3. **Lagging Signals:**  
   The moving average crossover strategy suffered from lagging signals, causing it to miss some recovery periods.
